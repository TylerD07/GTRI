## Inspiration

- We want to see GT win even more games!

## What it does

- Accumulates data from social media outlets. Then uses that data as input for a machine learning algorithm to compose a profile of candidates. These profiles can be search from the main page or filtered on different parameters.

## How we built it

- We started with developing the back-end to hand all the API and search request. This information is store in a database that will then populate the a simple easy to navigate front end.

## Challenges we ran into

- Privacy
- API limits
- Group functionally
- Time

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Overall grind of the group
- Passion for learning of my members
- The development of a wonderful idea into what it is now

## What we learned

- IMB's Watson
- Group functionality
- Node.js
- Python scraping
- Project management

## What's next for gtri

### The future is very bright. We have a ton of ideas to still implement into the project to make it the best tool for recruiting.

- We want to work with coaches to find the most important values and qualities they need in a players

#### It is important to have an application that is very informative and gives the coaches what they want as far as data
